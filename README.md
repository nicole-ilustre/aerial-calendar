Aerial Calendar is my first personal project. I wanted to recreate the booking system called Gymmaster. This is waht we use in my dance studio to book in to our classes.

I thought it would be a good idea to remake something I am already familiar with as a user so I would have an idea as to how the app should behave and look like.

I used React for front-end and SQLite 3 for databases. It's still a work in progress.

Some features I would want to add are:
-Authentication
-More functionaility like unbooking/deleting classes
-Admin log in and functionalities like editing and adding classes
-tests

The client will be available on http://localhost:8080 and the server on http://localhost:3000. Note that you will still need to manage CORS between the two, as they are on different ports.
